## Some language specific instructions
- [OCaml](docs/ocaml.md)

## Get the input
the input for the challenges is different for each user and thus requires a session cookie.

### get the cookie
please follow the steps in [wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim#1](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) to get your personal session cookie :thumbsup:

### store the cookie
according to [this sub reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/z9dhtd/please_include_your_contact_info_in_the_useragent/),
one should also include their email in the metadata of the GET requests :ok_hand:

please store your information in a NUON file with the following format:
```nushell
{
    cookie: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    mail: "xxxx@xxx.xxx"
}
```

i also recommend encrypting this sensitive file with
```shell
gpg --symmetric --armor --cipher-algo <algo> <file>
```
to have it available as a `.asc` file.

### test solutions with the AoC API
with Nushell,
```nushell
use toolkit.nu
use std assert

use solutions/2024/nushell/day_1
use solutions/2024/nushell/day_2
use solutions/2024/nushell/day_3
use solutions/2024/nushell/day_4
use solutions/2024/nushell/day_5
let sols = [
    [ silver, gold ];

    [ { day_1 silver }, { day_1 gold } ],
    [ { day_2 silver }, { day_2 gold } ],
    [ { day_3 silver }, { day_3 gold } ],
    [ { day_4 silver }, { day_4 gold } ],
    [ { day_5 silver }, { day_5 gold } ],
]

let login = {
    cookie: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    mail: "xxxx@xxx.xxx"
}
let inputs = 1..5 | each { |d|
    print --no-newline $"pulling inputs: ($d)\r"
    toolkit aoc get-data --login $login --year 2024 $d
}
let answers = 1..5 | each { |d|
    print --no-newline $"pulling answers: ($d)\r"
    toolkit aoc get-answers --login $login --year 2024 $d
}

# NOTE: ommitting day 4 because the solution is way too slow...
for day in ($inputs | wrap input | merge ($answers | wrap answers) | merge ($sols | wrap sol) | drop nth 3) {
    assert equal ($day.input | do $day.sol.silver) $day.answers.silver
    if $day.answers.gold != null {
        assert equal ($day.input | do $day.sol.gold) $day.answers.gold
    }
}
```
