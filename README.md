## Some language specific instructions
- [OCaml](docs/ocaml.md)

## Get the input
the input for the challenges is different for each user and thus requires a session cookie.

### get the cookie
please follow the steps in [wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim#1](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) to get your personal session cookie :thumbsup:

### store the cookie
according to [this sub reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/z9dhtd/please_include_your_contact_info_in_the_useragent/),
one should also include their email in the metadata of the GET requests :ok_hand:

please store your information in a NUON file with the following format:
```nushell
{
    cookie: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    mail: "xxxx@xxx.xxx"
}
```

i also recommend encrypting this sensitive file with
```shell
gpg --symmetric --armor --cipher-algo <algo> <file>
```
to have it available as a `.asc` file.
